				What is plastic waste?<br>
				: Plastic waste is a waste produced by humans, and it threatens the earth’s environment.

				Also, due to the significant amount of plastic waste thrown in the ocean, which is also referred to as a “plastic island” due to its huge amount and its size is almost similar as an island.

				The reason why plastic waste is more critical<br>

				Plastic is a synthetic material that is made out of polymer molecules. Due to its strong and special shape of molecular bond, it is immune to digestive activity of living organisms. 
				It also has outstanding longevity, it is not decomposed naturally for thousands of years.

									How serious is it?<br>
									We are producing about over 300 million tonnes of plastic waste each year, which is 5/144 million tons of plastic waste each hour.

									Due to these tremendous amounts of plastic produced, we are having a negative impact on our ocean and threatening the wildlives.

									Here are some photo of plastic island and look at that tremendous amount.

									Impact on Nature:<br>
									Plastic threatens many wild creatures’ lives by polluting their habitat. Plastic waste in underground pollutes land and it changes into sterile land.
									Plants will be hard to absorb the nutrients from the ground, because their roots are poisoned by the toxic substances from plastic wastes.
									Without plants, many herbivores and symbionts of plants won’t grow. Also, the number of predators who hunt those animals will be diminished.<br>
									During the incineration of plastic, large amounts of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are released into the atmosphere, and carbon dioxide is one of the main factors of global warming.
									Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas which poisons lung and respiratory systems. By these problems, many organism on the earth will be affected and damaged by effect of plastic waste
									Marine ecosystem is also a victim of plastic pollution. According to the research, 150 million tons of plastic wastes are currently circulating the marine environments.
									Plastics block the digestive system of marine creatures, or it sticks to their gills thus makes them sophisticated.

									Impact on Society:<br>
									Economical:<br>
									During the process of incinerating the plastic, it produces a lot of carbon monoxide and dioxide, which lead to stimulation of global warming.
									Also, the incineration of plastic is economically inefficient because it requires a lot of fuels to ignite it.<br>

									Social:<br>
									Many people do not like plastic recycling centers near them, because it may damage their “image” and “value” of their towns or cities.
									Also, so-called “nano plastic” may exist in many animals such as fish or mammals, and it comes back to humans through the food we eat.

				Conclusion : Humans are not the owner of the earth, and we should be responsible for the damage from the plastic that we made and emitted.
				To prevent further damage, we should reduce the usage of plastic, and increase the frequency of recycling of plastic.
